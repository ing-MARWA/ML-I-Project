# Titanic Dataset

This repository contains the famous Titanic dataset, which is often used as a beginner-friendly dataset for data analysis and machine learning tasks. The dataset provides information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including their demographic details, cabin class, survival status, and more.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of two files:
- train.csv: This file contains the training set with known outcomes (survived or not) for each passenger.
- test.csv: This file contains the test set without any outcome labels. The goal is to predict whether these passengers survived based on a trained model.

Both CSV files have similar columns that include:

1. PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
2. Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
3. Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st class; 2 = 2nd class; 3 = 3rd class)
4. Name: Passenger's name
5. Sex: Gender of the passenger
6. Age: Age in years
7. SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
8. Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
9. Ticket: Ticket number
10. Fare: Fare price paid by the passenger
11. Cabin: Cabin number occupied by the passenger (if available)
12. Embarked Port where they embarked from (C=Cherbourg; Q=Queenstown; S=Southampton)

## Objective

The main objective with this dataset is usually to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a given passenger would survive or not based on their features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

## Usage

Here are some potential use cases for this dataset:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing various aspects of the dataset, such as survival rates based on different variables.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
- Machine Learning Modeling: Training machine learning models to predict passenger survival using classification algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with this dataset:
1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Use a programming language and data analysis libraries (such as Python with pandas and scikit-learn) to read and analyze the data files (train.csv and test.csv).
3. Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables.
4. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling/normalization, etc., depending on your modeling approach.
5. Split the training set into train/validation subsets for model training and evaluation purposes.
6. Train various machine learning models using appropriate algorithms for binary classification tasks based on your objectives.
7. Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics like accuracy, precision/recall/F1-score, ROC-AUC curve, etc., against validation/test sets.
8. Fine-tune hyperparameters of selected models if necessary through techniques like grid search or cross-validation for better results.
